This package is simply a small test to check if your filetype is supported for transcription by Deepgram. Deepgram supports over 100 different audio formats and encodings. For example, some of the most common audio formats and encodings we support include MP3, MP4, MP2, AAC, WAV, FLAC, PCM, M4A, Ogg, Opus, and WebM.

> Because audio format is largely unconstrained, we always recommend to ensure compatibility by testing small sets of audio when first operating with new audio sources.

This is not an exhaustive or official list. If it isn't on the list, try it anyway. You might find the audio source can be transcribed.
